## Abstract
A real-time sign language translator is an important milestone in facilitating communication between the deaf community and the general public. We hereby present an approach of an American Sign Language (ASL) translator based on a convolutional neural network. <br />
We are going to utilize the pre-trained SSD model architecture for the real-time recognition of the ASL using the concept of transfer learning and to give
a try to deal with dynamic gestures. The main objectives of this project are to develop an accurate and efficient ASL recognition system, to improve communication between the deaf and hearing communities, and to promote inclusivity and accessibility for all. <br />
The system has been evaluated on a dataset of ASL gestures and has achieved an accuracy of over 90 In summary, the Real-time American Sign Language Recognition System is a promising solution for bridging the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities. It provides an efficient, accurate, and accessible means of communicating in ASL, which can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with hearing impairments. The system can also be extended to include additional features such as gesture recognition for other sign languages.
